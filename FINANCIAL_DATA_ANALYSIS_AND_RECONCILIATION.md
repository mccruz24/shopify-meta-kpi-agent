# Financial Data Analysis & Reconciliation Strategy

## Current Financial Data Extraction System Overview

Your financial analytics system is extracting comprehensive transaction-level data from Shopify and storing it in a Notion database. Here's what's being captured:

### Data Sources
- **Primary Source**: Shopify API (Admin API 2023-10)
- **Target Database**: Notion Financial Analytics Database (ID: 21e8db45e2f98061a311f3a875b96e16)
- **Related Database**: Orders Analytics Database (ID: 21e8db45e2f980b99159f9da13f924a8)

### Financial Data Being Extracted

#### Core Transaction Data
1. **Transaction Identity**
   - Transaction ID (unique identifier)
   - Order Reference (links to orders database)
   - Order Number
   - Date/Timestamp

2. **Financial Metrics**
   - **Gross Amount**: Total transaction value
   - **Processing Fee**: Calculated based on payment method and gateway
   - **Net Amount**: Gross - Processing Fee
   - **Currency**: Transaction currency
   - **Exchange Rate**: For multi-currency tracking

3. **Payment Details**
   - **Payment Method**: credit_card, paypal, apple_pay, google_pay, shop_pay
   - **Payment Gateway**: shopify_payments, paypal, etc.
   - **Card Type**: Visa, Mastercard, etc. (when available)
   - **Last 4 Digits**: Masked card numbers
   - **Authorization Code**: Payment authorization reference

4. **Transaction Classification**
   - **Transaction Type**: sale, refund, authorization, capture, void
   - **Status**: success, pending, error, failure
   - **Risk Level**: low, medium, high (calculated based on amount, gateway, status)
   - **Fraud Score**: Risk assessment score

5. **Geographic & Device Data**
   - **Customer Country**: Based on shipping/billing address
   - **IP Country**: Geographic location indicator
   - **Device Type**: Desktop, mobile, etc. (limited data available)
   - **Browser**: User agent information

6. **Additional Tracking**
   - **Gateway Reference**: External payment processor reference
   - **Settlement Date**: When funds are settled (when available)
   - **Disputed**: Chargeback/dispute status
   - **AVS Result**: Address verification system result
   - **CVV Result**: Card verification value result

### Processing Fee Calculation Logic

The system calculates estimated processing fees based on:
- **Shopify Payments**: 2.9% + $0.30 for most methods
- **External PayPal**: 3.4% + $0.30
- **Rate Structure**: Configurable based on your actual payment processor rates

### Data Quality & Limitations

#### What's Available:
✅ Complete transaction-level financial data
✅ Real-time processing fee calculations
✅ Risk assessment and fraud indicators
✅ Geographic and payment method breakdown
✅ Automated daily data collection
✅ Duplicate detection and handling

#### Current Limitations:
⚠️ Settlement dates require additional API calls (not implemented)
⚠️ Card types and last 4 digits limited by API access
⚠️ Device/browser data limited in transaction API
⚠️ Dispute information requires separate API integration
⚠️ Some fraud analysis data not captured

## Financial Data Reconciliation Strategies

### 1. Multi-Source Reconciliation Framework

#### A. Payment Gateway Reconciliation
```
Daily Process:
1. Shopify Transaction Data (your current system)
2. Payment Gateway Reports (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
3. Bank Deposit Records
4. Accounting System (QuickBooks, Xero)

Key Fields for Matching:
- Gateway Reference ID
- Transaction Amount
- Transaction Date
- Authorization Code
```

#### B. Order-to-Payment Reconciliation
```
Your system already links:
- Financial transactions → Orders database
- This enables order-level reconciliation

Validation Points:
- Order total = Sum of successful sale transactions
- Refund amounts match order refund records
- Transaction count per order matches expected payments
```

### 2. Automated Reconciliation Rules

#### Daily Reconciliation Checks
1. **Amount Matching**
   - Compare gross amounts across systems
   - Verify processing fee calculations
   - Check net deposit amounts

2. **Transaction Status Validation**
   - Ensure failed transactions don't appear in deposits
   - Verify refund transactions reduce net amounts
   - Check authorization vs. capture timing

3. **Period-End Reconciliation**
   - Weekly/monthly settlement reconciliation
   - Currency conversion validation for international sales
   - Fee structure verification against actual processor charges

### 3. Reconciliation Database Schema

#### Proposed Additional Notion Database: "Financial Reconciliation"
```
Properties:
- Date (Date)
- Reconciliation Type (Select: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Gateway, Manual)
- Source System (Select: Shopify, Stripe, PayPal, Bank, QuickBooks)
- Expected Amount (Number)
- Actual Amount (Number)
- Variance (Formula: Expected - Actual)
- Variance % (Formula: Variance/Expected * 100)
- Status (Select: Matched, Discrepancy, Investigating, Resolved)
- Notes (Rich Text)
- Related Transactions (Relation to Financial Analytics)
```

### 4. Implementation Recommendations

#### Phase 1: Data Quality Enhancement

   - Add settlement date extraction
   - Implement dispute status checking
   - Improve card type detection
   - Add currency conversion rates

2. **Create Validation Rules**
   - Duplicate transaction detection
   - Amount reasonableness checks
   - Date range validation
   - Gateway-specific validation rules

#### Phase 2: Automated Reconciliation
1. **Payment Gateway Integration**
   - Stripe API integration for settlement data
   - PayPal API for transaction verification
   - Bank file import automation
   - Automated variance detection

2. **Reconciliation Workflows**
   - Daily automated reconciliation runs
   - Exception reporting and alerts
   - Manual investigation queues
   - Resolution tracking

#### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics
1. **Financial Health Monitoring**
   - Real-time cash flow tracking
   - Fee optimization analysis
   - Chargeback rate monitoring
   - Geographic performance analysis

2. **Predictive Analytics**

   - Fraud risk assessment
   - Optimal payment method routing
   - Settlement timing optimization

### 5. Specific Reconciliation Scripts

#### A. Daily Settlement Reconciliation
```python
# Proposed reconciliation check
def daily_settlement_reconciliation(date):
    shopify_transactions = get_shopify_transactions(date)
    gateway_settlements = get_gateway_settlements(date)
    bank_deposits = get_bank_deposits(date)
    
    return compare_amounts(shopify_transactions, gateway_settlements, bank_deposits)
```

#### B. Transaction-Level Matching
```python
# Match transactions across systems
def match_transactions(shopify_tx, gateway_tx):
    matches = []
    for shopify in shopify_tx:
        gateway_match = find_matching_transaction(shopify, gateway_tx)
        matches.append({
            'shopify': shopify,
            'gateway': gateway_match,
            'matched': bool(gateway_match),
            'variance': calculate_variance(shopify, gateway_match)
        })
    return matches
```

### 6. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Reconciliation

#### Daily Metrics
- **Match Rate**: % of transactions successfully matched
- **Variance Amount**: Total $ variance across systems
- **Processing Time**: Time to complete reconciliation
- **Exception Count**: Number of unmatched transactions

#### Monthly Metrics
- **Fee Accuracy**: Actual vs. calculated processing fees
- **Settlement Timing**: Average days from transaction to deposit
- **Dispute Rate**: % of transactions disputed
- **Currency Variance**: Impact of exchange rate fluctuations

### 7. Alert System Design

#### Critical Alerts
- Variance > $100 or 5% on any single transaction
- Daily settlement variance > $500
- Failed reconciliation runs
- Duplicate transaction detection

#### Warning Alerts
- Processing fee variance > 10%
- Unusual transaction patterns
- Gateway performance issues
- Currency rate fluctuations > 2%

## Next Steps for Implementation
