## 🔍 How to Spot Discrepancies

### Common Issues to Check:

#### 1. **Missing Transactions**
- Compare transaction count in Notion vs Shopify admin
- Look for failed/pending transactions

#### 2. **Fee Calculation Errors**
```
If a $100 sale shows $5.00 in fees instead of $3.20:
→ Flag as discrepancy
→ Check actual gateway rates
→ Update fee calculation if needed
```

#### 3. **Settlement Timing**
```
If bank deposit doesn't match expected amount:
→ Check settlement dates
→ Some transactions may settle next day
→ Weekend transactions may delay until Monday
```

#### 4. **Currency Conversion**
```
For international sales:
→ Check exchange rates used
→ Compare Shopify rate vs actual bank rate
→ Account for forex fees
```
