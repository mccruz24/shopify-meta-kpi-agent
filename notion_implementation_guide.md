# 🛠️ Notion Dashboard Implementation Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start: Setting Up Your Analytics Dashboard

### Phase 1: Create Master Dashboard Database (30 minutes)

#### Step 1: Create New Database
```
1. Create new database called "📊 Daily KPI Dashboard"

💰 Revenue (Number) 
📦 Orders (Number)
💳 Ad Spend (Number)
🏭 COGS (Number)
📊 Profit (Formula)
📈 ROAS (Formula)
🎯 AOV (Formula)
📊 Profit Margin (Formula)
⚡ Status (Select)
```

#### Step 2: Add Formula Properties
```
Profit Formula:
prop("Revenue") - prop("Ad Spend") - prop("COGS")

ROAS Formula:
if(prop("Ad Spend") > 0, prop("Revenue") / prop("Ad Spend"), 0)

AOV Formula:
if(prop("Orders") > 0, prop("Revenue") / prop("Orders"), 0)

Profit Margin Formula:
if(prop("Revenue") > 0, (prop("Profit") / prop("Revenue")) * 100, 0)
```

#### Step 3: Set Up Status Indicators
```
Status Select Options:
🟢 On Track (Green)
🟡 Warning (Yellow)  
🔴 Critical (Red)
⚪ No Data (Gray)

Status Formula (Advanced):
if(prop("ROAS") >= 3.0 and prop("Profit Margin") >= 25, "🟢 On Track",
   if(prop("ROAS") >= 2.5 and prop("Profit Margin") >= 20, "🟡 Warning",
      "🔴 Critical"))

```
