# How to Solve the $2,049 vs $674.45 Discrepancy

## üéØ Your Exact Problem:
- **Shopify Sales Report**: $2,049 for July 29, 2025

- **Discrepancy**: $1,374.55 (67% missing!)

---

## üîç Step-by-Step Investigation

### Step 1: Set Up Your API Credentials

**Create a `.env` file in your workspace:**
```bash
# Add these to your .env file:
SHOPIFY_SHOP_URL=your-shop-name.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
NOTION_TOKEN=your_notion_token
```

### Step 2: Run the Discrepancy Investigator

```bash
# Run with your real API credentials
python3 shopify_date_discrepancy_investigator.py
```

**This will analyze:**
- ‚úÖ Orders created on July 29 (regardless of payment date)
- ‚úÖ Transactions processed on July 29 (regardless of order date)
- ‚úÖ Cross-reference to find timing mismatches
- ‚úÖ Generate detailed report with recommendations

### Step 3: Manual Verification Commands

**A. Check your current transaction extraction:**
```bash
# See exactly what your system captures
python3 financial_analytics_sync.py 2025-07-29
```

**B. Run reconciliation analysis:**
```bash
# Validate processing fees and detect anomalies
python3 financial_reconciliation.py 2025-07-29
```

**C. Export raw Shopify data for comparison:**
```bash
# Create diagnostic script to export raw order data
python3 -c "
from src.extractors.financial_analytics_extractor import FinancialAnalyticsExtractor
from datetime import datetime
import json

extractor = FinancialAnalyticsExtractor()

# Get orders created on July 29
orders_data = extractor._make_request('orders.json', {
    'status': 'any',
    'created_at_min': '2025-07-29T00:00:00Z',
    'created_at_max': '2025-07-30T00:00:00Z',
    'limit': 250
})

with open('july_29_orders_raw.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(orders_data, f, indent=2)

print(f'Orders created July 29: {len(orders_data.get(\"orders\", []))}')
print(f'Total value: \${sum(float(o.get(\"total_price\", 0)) for o in orders_data.get(\"orders\", []))}')
"
```

## üîç Most Likely Explanations

### Theory 1: Order Creation vs Payment Processing Date Mismatch

**What's happening:**
- Shopify report: Counts orders by **creation date** (July 29)
- Your system: Counts transactions by **payment processing date** (July 29)

**Investigation:**
```bash
# Check if orders created July 29 were paid on different days
# Look for these patterns in the investigation report:
# - Orders created July 29 with financial_status: "pending"
# - Orders created July 29 with financial_status: "authorized" (not captured)
# - Transactions processed July 29 for orders created July 28
```

### Theory 2: Transaction Status Filtering

**What's happening:**
- Shopify report: Includes all orders regardless of payment status
- Your system: Only captures "successful" transactions

**Check this:**
```bash
# Modify your extractor to include ALL transaction statuses
# Look for:
# - Pending authorizations
# - Failed payment attempts
# - Partial payments
# - Manual payment entries
```

### Theory 3: Multi-Payment Orders

**What's happening:**
- Orders paid with multiple methods (gift card + credit card)
- Installment payments
- Split payments across multiple days

**Investigation command:**
```bash
# Look for orders with multiple transactions
# Check for payment methods like: gift_card, store_credit, layaway
```

## üìä Expected Investigation Results

### Scenario A: Date Mismatch (Most Likely)
```
Orders created July 29: $2,049 (matches Shopify report)
Transactions processed July 29: $674.45 (matches your system)

Mismatches found:
- 5 orders created July 29 but payment pending: $987.50
- 3 orders created July 29 but only authorized: $387.05
- Total missing from transactions: $1,374.55 ‚úÖ
```

### Scenario B: Status Filtering Issue
```
All transactions July 29 (including pending): $2,049
Successful transactions only: $674.45

Missing transaction types:
- Pending: $456.75
- Authorized: $543.20
- Failed (later retried): $374.60
- Total: $1,374.55 ‚úÖ
```

### Scenario C: Complex Multi-Day Scenario
```
Orders created July 28, paid July 29: $234.56
Orders created July 29, paid July 30: $1,139.99
Mixed payment timing creates discrepancy
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions Based on Investigation Results

### Solution 1: Fix Date Logic
```python
# Update your extractor to handle both scenarios:
def extract_comprehensive_date_data(date):
    # Method 1: Orders created on date (Shopify report style)
    orders_created = get_orders_by_creation_date(date)
    
    # Method 2: Transactions processed on date (current system)
    transactions_processed = get_transactions_by_processing_date(date)
    
    # Method 3: Hybrid approach - orders created AND paid on date
    orders_created_and_paid = get_orders_created_and_paid_same_day(date)
    
    return {
        'orders_created': orders_created,
        'transactions_processed': transactions_processed,
        'same_day_orders': orders_created_and_paid
    }
```

### Solution 2: Expand Transaction Status Capture
```python
# Include all transaction statuses, not just successful
def extract_all_transaction_statuses(date):
    # Current: only 'success' status
    # New: 'success', 'pending', 'authorized', 'failed', 'voided'
    
    transactions = []
    for status in ['success', 'pending', 'authorized', 'failure']:
        status_transactions = get_transactions_by_status(date, status)
        transactions.extend(status_transactions)
    
    return transactions
```

### Solution 3: Enhanced Reconciliation Logic
```python
# Create multiple reconciliation perspectives
def multi_perspective_reconciliation(date):
    return {
        'shopify_sales_report_perspective': get_orders_by_creation_date(date),
        'cash_flow_perspective': get_transactions_by_processing_date(date),
        'accounting_perspective': get_completed_orders_by_date(date),
        'bank_reconciliation_perspective': get_settled_transactions_by_date(date)
    }
```
